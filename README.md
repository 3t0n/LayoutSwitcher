# About
LayoutSwitcher is open-source application that allows you to change keyboard layout using shortcuts that are not alloved by MacOS: Fn + Shift ⇧, Option ⌥ + Shift ⇧, Command ⌘ + Shift ⇧ or Control ⌃ + Shift ⇧. In some sence it an alternative for the Punto Switcher or Karabiner if you are using it for similar purpose, because both are kind of overkill for this.
